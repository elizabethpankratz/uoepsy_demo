This page contains (1) an extended analysis of the anxiety data from the teaching presentation using `MASS::polr()`.

It also illustrates two less good ways to analyse ordinal data: (2) just treating it as numeric and using a Gaussian model, and (3) first converting it to z-scores and then using a Gaussian model.
